      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know debugging skills are very important and one of the &amp;ldquo;must have&amp;rdquo; skills for developers. However I did not explicitly tried to learn how to use and utilize VSCode debugger effectively. While reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/using-an-integrated-debugger-stepping/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; during my entry to c++, I thought now was the right time to look into features VS Code gives, which were worth note taking. Today is just a shallow dive and hope to learn deeper when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
