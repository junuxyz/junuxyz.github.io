1. **high (abstract) level pattern recognition**
	- writing style, nuance, insight
	- understanding the underlying message despite of words and content, just the underlying message etc.

2. **overcoming data bottleneck**
	- data is the fossil fuel of AI but we have only one Internet - Ilya Sutskever
	- how can we create more data?
		- synthetic data
		- RLHF and DPO
		- metrifying subjective information

3. **how to deploy static models in dynamic world**
	- continuous learning
	- are our mental models also static? Maybe we think statically, too (based on our past knowledge and experience)

4. **how to make models more reliable**
	- autonomous cars are not deployed yet because of 0.0001% edge cases. LLMs are less deployed yet because they can make mistakes to people.
	- How can we deal with edge cases? Is it fundamentally 

5. **Reinforcement Learning to its extent**
	- something like [AlphaProof](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/)

6. **Self Supervised Reinforcement Learning**

7. **Simulation Learning implied to Robotics**
	- Convert human action (using something like SAM) into the robot's custom software and train it. Then use the software for robot to act as the trained dataset.
	- Something like Real Steel

8. **Education in AI**
	- What should be 'taught' and 'learned' in the "ChatGPT" era
