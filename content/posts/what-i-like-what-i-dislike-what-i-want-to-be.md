### What I Like

1. **Deep focused life**

	**Why?**
	- because I feel most satisfied and happy when I'm in a state of deep focus (or _flow_). When I'm not immersed and my mind wanders, I just end up with pointless anxieties.

	**How to achieve**
	- Time is limited so pick carefully what to do.
	- Delete elements that are harmful for the flow state.
	- Optimize or delegate things that are not related to my core interest but are needed in regular basis (ex. meal, workout, life habits, and chores etc.)
		- Best way to optimize is to make principles.
		- Principles are means and we must have purpose for it. When this is misleaded and following the principles itself becomes a purpose, innovation stops. Then inefficiency and distrust increases.
		- Similarly, optimization is not for the sake of optimization. It's to focus on the core values I believe in limited amount of time. Pre-optimization for things that may not be used in the future might be an inefficient thing.
	- Make my own _game_. 
		- What is a good game? There is a whole lot to think about this but I'll keep it short for now.
		- It is more robust to set the definition of _winning_ on internal reward than external reward.
		- Definition of winning should be _measurable_ because [you can't manage what you can't measure](https://www.growthink.com/content/two-most-important-quotes-business).
	- Leverage habits.
	- Being impulsive harms flow state. However, since I am an impulsive person, I should make system that will handle the risk of ruining my life's priority.

2. **Exciting life**
	
	Why?
	- I want to have reason to do something. A reason to wake up everyday. Not only because of responsibility but just the excitement of what I'm doing or what situation I am. I often forget but if we just try to change our perspective, life can be an exciting adventure.

3. **Making things, Being a Maker**
	
	**Why?**
	- Naval Ravikant said the two most important skills in modern era is [selling and building](https://nav.al/build-sell). I don't think I have good speech/sales skills. I do like making things. I like to create things and show them to people. It would be fulfilling and meaningful to see people enjoy and find it helpful of what I've made.
<br>

4. **Peers and Friends whom I can share my thoughts and life**

	**Why?**
	- I like thinking. I like ideas. I like innovation. I like talking about those things with others. I want to hear what others think. I like thinking out of the box. One of the best way to think out of the box is talking with other people. It gives lots of insights and makes life more abundant.
	- One thing I've learned from Psychology is that [money can't buy happiness](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/evolution-in-daily-life/202208/why-money-doesnt-buy-happiness). After certain amount of money, what matters is good relationship with friends and families. I also believe this is true.

5. **Amount of wealth I need to focus on 1 (=Deep focused life independent of external conditions).**

	**Why?**
	- I don't necessarily want and need to be a millionaire. I just want to have enough money to support myself, my family, and my loved ones. I want to have enough money to not think about money. That would be approximately be ~ 100k/year. It's still a lot of money but I don't think I need **more** than that.
	- I would rather choose a meaningful, enjoyable work environment than to work for something I don't enjoy but get highly paid after that.
	- Supporting my family is more important that becoming a rich person. I need to have enough money to not worry about money. I want to have enough to support my wife or children or parents when they are in need.

<br>

6. **Disciplined Life**

	**Why?**
	- We can do a lot of things, but we can't do everything.
	- So we need to choose what to choose and focus on.
	- Disciplined life helps this.
	- Consistency makes compound effect. Consistency is the key.
