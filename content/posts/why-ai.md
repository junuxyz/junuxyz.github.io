Today I am going to talk about what attracted me to this field and why I am pursuing my career path as an AI engineer, despite all the hype and saturation in the market.

I went to University as a Psychology student. I was interested in how we think and how we percieve the world. Generally I was more intersted in the philosophical side of human mind than the scientific side.

I don't know when exactly I was into Artificial Intelligence. Maybe reading _[Digital VS Human](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Human-well-think-future/dp/1925228428)_ by Richard Watson was the first time I got interested in AI. Then I read some other Korean books like [AI 최강의 수업](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001832036) and [에이트](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000001913906). Though the only book I recommend would be _AI 최강의 수업_ (other books are more like a sci-fi book), all those books got me interested in AI and its potential to impact the world.

But I went to the military and put aside of AI for a while. After all, I was just a Psychology student who didn't know much about IT or AI. In military I read lots of books. I've read some self-helping books(lol), books on how to write, how to think, some classical fiction books, and many more. I don't think I read books about AI necessarily. But I did try several times using ChatGPT as my learning tutor (especially for English).

Then I finished the service and attended a 8~12 week Start up Camp. I've met many people from different domains and saw the potential of AI again. At that time people were figuring out how to use ChatGPT3.5 and GPT4 APIs and integrate them as a service. They were called _GPT wrappers_. Voice demos or image recognitions and many more fascinated me and gave me a sense this is _something_. During the Start up Camp, I listened to Andrew Ng Proffessor's Supervised Learning course (like every machine learning newbie does)

This is what I wrote while learning AI for the first time:

Anyways it was clear I was getting more and more interested in AI. I didn't try to learn and go deeper AI right away, though. I was open to many other experiences and luckily had a chance to work in an early startup as a frontend developer. Since I didn't have much technical background, working as a developer seemed a good experience for me. However after some experience as a frontend dev, I've understood this is not exactly what I wanted to do and I finally understood that I wanted to work on AI. AI seemed a lot more impactful and lot more fun. So I quit working there and attended a school club and started double-majoring Computer Science. Half a year passed and while I've got some more experience on AI, I still feel like a newbie going through tutorial hells instead of picking a direction and growing fast.

Recently I've got to know a field called MLSys which is system engineering for Deep Learning, working on ML compilers, hardware-software codesign, and low-level(CUDA-level) system programming. 

Now I have about an year and half left before graduation.




I want to be in _flow_ state. Deep work, passion and excitement on what I'm doing that's thrilling and exciting to me. 
I want to wake up every morning excited what to do. 
I want to know what excites you and pursue the thing.

Some of my ideal figures are:
- Brad Pitt from F1 the movie; his pursuit for feeling the flow state when driving.
- MIT makers portfolio; their pure passion and enthusiasm on what they are making.
- Ilya and Demis: their pure pursuit and passion to AI especially when they weren't necessarily _cool_ and were treated as pseudo science at that time.
- Focusing on hard but exciting problems for hours and hours and finally... getting it

To be extremely transparent, I previously wanted to be a MLSys or MLOps developer (which I may become later) But I should say I dont want to be MLSys dev actually. I just wanted to make high salary with less saturation. That's why I chose MLSys or MLOps as a conservative decision. (Like working as a quant; high salary with NO MEANING) This is understandable because I am already 23 years old, only have 1.5 years before graduating University, and nothing to be confident about now (kind of directionless and lost ..) and I don't want to be jobless.

But I honestly think there's actually so much fun and exciting things out there rather than focusing on optimizing CUDA for the rest of my career. The reason I was excited about AI wasn't because of optimizing GPU hardwares but because I can solve real world problems, gain insights unseeable in humans eyes, find meaningful pattern in complex system.

I know I want to do something NOT for spec, but for my intrinsic goal and pursuit of exciting journey. The problem is I don't know what that is, yet. I only have the dream of going into flow state, and do really hard but also meaningful things.

So I'm kind of lost, while others are pursuing some kind of goal I'm just idealizing things.
