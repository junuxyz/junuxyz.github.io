### The Process

1. **Define and Identify the problem.**
	- Can you define and express the problem in numbers? (e.g. computing speed is so slow it takes more than 10 minutes to do x, this method has 20% more memory usage than the other method etc.)
	- [Think if that problem is even worth solving](https://youtu.be/YFUVMPOIeAo?si=ba_aXfU1Ge3GpRWR).

2. **Analyze the root cause of the problem**
	- What _exactly_ is the problem? Find the root cause
	- Why do you think it's a problem?
	- Find where the bottleneck lies.
	- Understand the mechanism (what goes under the hood?): input and output
	- Complicated domains and subjects are mostly due to multiple layers of abstraction.
	- Keep dividing until you narrow down to the core reason.

3. **Solution Design**
	- Approach in 1st principle
	- Check the latest trials from others
	- Read, experiment, debate about it

4. **Implement the design**
	- Fail fast and iterate _a lot_. Done is better than perfect
	- Make it work first, then refine it


Keep iterating this cycle until you solve it. There is no more secret sauce, only grind.

### Axioms

1. An individual cannot know every detail about everything but one can go through _a lot_ to find and fix a problem. You don't need to _know_ everything until you start solving the problem. You get to know along as you try to solve it. In other words, most knowledge should be a byproduct of trial and error, not earned by memorizing things and preparing for school exams.
