If you want to be a pro, imagine the job role or the company you want to get in. Google, Tesla, Facebook, Apple, etc... logically you need to work as much or harder than that everyday.


Then, what should you work on?

Hard problems; the problems people are facing in the domain.

Find out and contemplate on

- what the problem is
- why it's a problem
- what have been done to solve the problem
- why those problems don't work
- what can be done to solve that problem
- why that can be a candidate logically (rationally)
- and do it
