## Junu Park

Hi. I'm an undergraduate student at Chung-Ang University, double majoring in Psychology and Computer Science. Currently I am advised by [Prof. Jeongseob Ahn](https://jeongseob.github.io/), focusing on Machine Learning Systems and Inference. I also run a public [Notion page](https://junuxyz.notion.site/) and a [blog](/blog/posts/) where I document what I learn.
