## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" >}}

Hi. I'm an undergraduate student at Chung-Ang University.
I am double majoring in Psychology and Computer Science. I'm exploring various areas of AI, currently focusing on machine learning systems and GPU optimization, while also interested in reinforcement learning and data efficiency.
I read and take notes on some books. (book reviews: [here](https://junuxyz.notion.site/books/)). I also run a public [Notion page](https://junuxyz.notion.site/) where I document and share most of what I learn or think about.
Outside academics, I work out daily and enjoy weekly sauna sessions.
