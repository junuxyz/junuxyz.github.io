## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" >}}

Hi. I'm an undergraduate student at Chung-Ang University.
I am double majoring Psychology and Computer Science. I'm exploring various areas of AI, currently focusing on machine learning systems and GPU optimization, while also interested in reinforcement learning and data efficiency.
I read and take notes on some books. (book reviews: [here](https://junuxyz.notion.site/books/)). I also run a public [Notion page](https://junuxyz.notion.site/) where I document and share most of what I learn or think about.
Beyond my technical/academic pursuits, I maintain a daily workout routine and enjoy sauna weekly.

## Research Interests
I'm exploring various areas of AI, currently focusing on:
- [**ML Systems**: GPU optimization, memory hierarchy, parallel computing](https://junuxyz.notion.site/mlsys)
- Efficient data processing and representation
- [Deep Reinforcement Learning and decision-making systems](https://junuxyz.notion.site/drl)

## Experience
