## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/images/avatar.jpg" alt="Avatar" >}}

Hi. I'm Junu. I am undergraduate student at Chung-Ang University.
I am double majoring in Psychology and Computer Science. I'm exploring various areas of AI, currently focusing on ML System and software/hardware co-design, while also interested in Reinforcement Learning and data representation.
I read and take notes on some books. (book reviews: [here](https://junuxyz.notion.site/books/)). I also run a public [Notion page](https://junuxyz.notion.site/) where I document and share most of what I learn or think about.
Outside academics, I work out daily and enjoy weekly sauna sessions.
