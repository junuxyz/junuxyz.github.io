### The Learning Fallacy

I used to watch a lot of motivational speech or Podcasts(Lex Fridman, DDCA etc.) on YouTube. I felt like I was spending my time productive, watching things that help me grow mentally and intellectually. However the reality was, these things didn't stick to me.

### The Problem with Vibe Coding

There are lots of 

Does Vibe Coding create value?
Yes, of course.

But I am still not sure if it's a _skill_. Even if it's a skill(instructions, prompt-engineering), I think it can be learned in a day. I call these _easy skills_.

Easy skills have not much economical value, because the market values rarity based on supply-demand graph.

The easy  it is(to be clear, the more predictable the action is), the more replacable it is.

### What If Hard Things get replaced by AI, as well?

Maybe, yes, doing hard things might still be relatively easy for AI to replace.
Either someone is a CRUD HTML monkey or a "ML Researcher" in "Big tech companies", if so called "Singularity" comes, every role might get replaced.

If this is true, should we still need to do harder things, in harder way?

There is no right answer to this but all I can say is if you're trying to learn from something, I believe you should do it in the harder way. 

You cannot gain the skills and knowledge without grinding and going into the fundamentals. It is not easy to understand the fundamentals of a system, and it takes time to get used to it.
