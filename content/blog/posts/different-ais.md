I agree that AI is a poorly defined term for such vast and broad technology it is. I came to a conclusion that people's, even expert's definition of AI are all different. 

AI will change the world is almost the same as "Software is going to change the world".
Yeah, of course it will change the world. But by what? How? Specifically ?

AI is more like a branch of technology using stochastic approach instead of static, deterministic, human defined algorithm.

But more importantly I think there are many different "end goals" researchers, practitioners, and companies are aiming for.

For example, DeepMind's AlphaGo and OpenAI's Five's vision was clear. Surpass the best human (player) in a well defined environment(the game of Go/Dota). They used Deep Reinforcement Learning to achieve this.

Then there is Generative AI like ChatGPT, which does not (or can't) aim to surpass human ability but tries to do tasks reasonably well. Current focus on Agents and Robots are similar to this approach: **Doing things average human can do.** 

I am not so sure about agents. They might become more reliable and seamless than what we have now, but I think it's just an extension or "wrapper" of current software programs (just a friendlier software).

The more interesting part I think is the novel findings in specific domains.
