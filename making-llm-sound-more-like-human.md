I found there are specific patterns LLMs like to use, which was annoying. For example, it uses a lot of unnecessary hyphens(`--`) and commas(`,`) -- more than twice as much as I would use.
It uses lots of metaphors that are either unaccurately read or a metaphor for the sake of metaphor (makes the concept too abstract that it's hard to understand how it actually is). This reddit post seems to put it nicely.
