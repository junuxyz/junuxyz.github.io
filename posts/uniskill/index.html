Introduction</h1><p>UniSkill uses image-editing pipeline for the neural network to focus on capturing the dynamics changes (over static content) between temproally distant video frames.</p><p>Since the dynamic changes in the vidoes are <em>motion,</em> the model learns the motion(dynamic) patterns as skill representations.</p><p>This enables the use of embodiment-agnostic video dataset, which means it includes videos performed by humans, leading to a lot more available training data.</p><p>Experiment result:</p><ul><li>UniSkill effectively learned cross-embodiment skill representation</li><li>generalized to unseen human prompts at test time without additional guide</li><li>enhance robustness to new objects and tasks</li><li>performance improved as more data sources were added

Here&rsquo;s how it differs:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Approach</th><th>Limitation/Differentiator</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>XSkill</td><td>Aligns skills from human and robot videos via Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering.</td><td>This clustering with shared prototypes implicitly assumes some degree of alignment between human and robot videos.

Method</h1><h2 id=31-problem-formulation>3.1. Problem Formulation</h2><h3 id=1-cross-embodiment-video-datasets-d_u--t_nn_a_n1><strong>1. Cross-embodiment video datasets</strong> ($D_u = {T_n}^{N_a}_{n=1}$)</h3><p>Videos that show both humans and robots doing things.</p><h3 id=2-robot-demonstration-datasets-d_a--t_nn_a_n1><strong>2. Robot demonstration datasets</strong> ($D_a = {T_n}^{N_a}_{n=1}$)</h3><p>Specifically robot videos that are &ldquo;action-labeled,&rdquo; which means they have information about what actions the robot took at each step.</p><p>$D_a$ is relatively smaller than $D_u$ ($N_u &#187; N_a$).
This is because there are a lot more unlabled humand/robot video data than high quality, curated, and action-labled robot video data.</p><h2 id=32-universal-skill-representation-learning>3.2: Universal Skill Representation Learning</h2><h3 id=isd-inverse-skill-dynamics-model>$ISD$ (Inverse Skill Dynamics Model)</h3><p>$$ z_t = ISD(I_t, I_{t+k}) $$</p><ul><li><strong>Input:</strong> Two temporally distant frames ($I_t$ and $I_{t+k}$) from a video $V$.</li><li>Problem: relying soley on RGB pixels/frames lead to encoding of embodiment-specific(in this case, human) details, which can hinder the learning of embodiment-agnostic behavior $z_t$.</li><li>to bypass this problem, UniSkill <strong>internally</strong> uses a depth estimation module to get depth information from these frames($I_t, I_{t+k}$).</li><li>This helps the model to understand scene’s dynamics and spatial relationships. As an output, we get a universal skill representation, $z_t$.</li></ul><h3 id=fsd-forward-skill-dynamics-model>$FSD$ (Forward Skill Dynamics Model)</h3><p>$$ I_{t+k} = FSD(I_t, z_t). $$</p><ul><li>predicts the future frame $I_{t+k}$ by given $I_t$ and $z_t$ from ISD.<ul><li>So basically UniSkill is using a form of self-supervised learning to train a universal skill representation($z_t$) that effecitvely encodes the dynamic changes between two video frames.</li><li>There would be minimal (~close to no) changes in the difference of $I_t$ and $I_{t+k}$ which are only $k$ frames apart, besides the embodiment’s dynamic components.</li><li>To prevent $z_t$ from naively assign $z_t = I_{t+k}$, we enforce an information bottleneck on $z_t$.</li><li>Specific method: reforming as an image prediction task. Same architecture/method as InstructPix2Pix but instead of using language instruction, uses $z_t$ instead.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=33-universal-skill-conditioned-policy>3.3. Universal Skill-Conditioned Policy</h2><p>How the robot is trained to exectue the skills it learned in the previous step.</p><p>This uses the smaller, high-quality, action-labled robot dataset $D_a$</p><h4 id=phi--textargmaxphi-eo_th-a_tth-sim-d_a-log-pi_phia_tth--o_t-z_t>$$\phi^* = \text{argmax}<em>\phi E(o_t, o</em>{t+h}, a_{t:t+h}) \sim D_a [\log \pi_\phi(a_{t:t+h} | o_t, z_t)].$$</h4><h3 id=breaking-down-the-formula>Breaking down the formula</h3><ul><li>$ϕ^∗$: This represents the <strong>optimal set</strong> of parameters for the policy network ($π$). The goal of the training process is to find these parameters.</li><li>$\text{argmax}_ϕ$: This means we are trying to find the value of $ϕ$ that maximizes the expression that follows it. In simple terms, we are searching for the best possible policy parameters.</li><li>$E(o_t,o_{t+h},a_{t:t+h}) \sim D_a$: This part specifies the <strong>data source</strong> for training. It means that the training is done by sampling a triplet of data points:<ul><li>$o_t$: The robot&rsquo;s observation at the current time step ($t$).</li><li>$o_{t+h}$: The robot&rsquo;s observation at a future time step ($t+h$), where $h$ is the action horizon.</li><li>$a_{t:t+h}$: The sequence of ground-truth (labled) actions from time $t$ to $t+h$.</li><li>The notation $\sim D_a$ indicates that these <strong>samples are drawn from the robot demonstration dataset</strong>, which is where the action labels are available.</li></ul></li><li>$[\logπ_ϕ(a_{t:t+h}∣o_t,z_t)]$: This is the core of the behavioral cloning objective.<ul><li>$π_ϕ$: This is the policy network with parameters $ϕ$. It is the function that we are training.</li><li>$a_{t:t+h}$: The sequence of actions that the policy is trying to predict.</li><li>$∣o_t,z_t$: These are the inputs to the policy network. The policy is &ldquo;conditioned on&rdquo; the current observation ($o_t$) and the universal skill representation ($z_t$). The skill representation $z_t$ is extracted from the robot demonstration data using the pre-trained ISD model.</li><li>$\log$: The logarithm is typically used in the training objective for stability and because maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to maximizing the probability.</li></ul></li></ul><p>so basically the source/distribution is on the left, the policy trying to optimized is on the right.</p><h2 id=34-cross-embodiment-imitation-with-universal-skill-representation>3.4.
