Just wanted to archive my old thoughts.</em></p><p>Today I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/CUnVY5IBvBA?si=IdfcA71fR3JtVfnP">video</a> and what struck me the most was this insight: <strong>In the end, what AI does is pattern recognition.</strong></p><blockquote><p>“If I had to explain what AI does in one sentence, I’d say: <strong>AI discovers latent patterns.</strong><br>In any domain where such latent patterns exist, AI will soon surpass human ability—and eventually replace humans.”
<em>From the video</em></p></blockquote><p>This might sound like an oversimplification, but I believe one of the main reasons humans have progressed this far is our ability to <strong>recognize and classify patterns.</strong></p><p>Ray Dalio refers to this as <em>principles</em>.
I’ve expressed it in terms of <em>template-ization</em>.</p><p>Of course, all living beings operate based on inherited instincts, but I think what sets humans apart is our ability to <strong>share subjectively constructed patterns through communication.</strong> (In fact, I believe the ultimate goal of all learning is the communication and sharing of knowledge.)</p><p>In other words, we interpret the complex world around us in a way that aligns with our goals (survival and reproduction), then we:<br>→ compress that interpretation<br>→ recognize patterns<br>→ build frameworks (or theories)<br>→ communicate those frameworks<br>→ and increase our collective knowledge and efficiency.</p><p>This is how I believe human civilization has developed.<br>But if AI can now learn these patterns better than us—<strong>especially in the case of unsupervised learning, where AI can discover patterns even humans can’t—</strong> then it will dominate in any domain where things can be patternized.</p><p>In the end, anything that <em>can</em> be patternized will eventually be replaced by AI.</p><p>This leads to a fundamental and chilling question:</p><h3 id=is-there-anything-that-cannot-be-patternized>Is there anything that <em>cannot</em> be patternized?</h3><p>If the answer is &ldquo;no,&rdquo; then ultimately everything is replaceable by AI.<br>And honestly, that seems highly plausible.</p><p>The world is often described as a <strong>complex system.</strong><br>It’s not governed by rigid rules like the game of Go, but it’s also not pure chaos with zero structure.<br>It lies somewhere in between—<strong>a blend of structure and randomness.</strong></p><p>In other words, <strong>the world contains both regularity and probability</strong>, and from that standpoint, I’d argue that nothing is truly patternless.</p><p>That doesn’t mean AI will perfectly solve everything (after all, probability deals with trends, not certainty), but at the very least, it’s likely to <strong>far surpass human capabilities.</strong></p><p>Even setting aside AlphaGo—where the rules are formalized—consider autonomous vehicles.<br>They still get into accidents, yes.<br>But humans get into far more.<br>As noted in a 2018 article, “37 out of 38 autonomous vehicle accidents were due to human error.”</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>So if AI potentially has the ability to recognize patterns (or, in my terms, <strong>build better templates</strong>) in every aspect of life, then I seriously question whether I should keep manually reverse-engineering, building, and refining those templates myself.</p><p>Wouldn’t it make far more sense to <strong>design an AI that can build those templates for me</strong>?</p><p>That’s something I’d really like to research and experiment with further.</p></div><nav class=post-nav><div class=nav-prev><a href=https://junuxyz.github.io/posts/fluent-python-cheat-sheet/ class=nav-link><span class=nav-label>← Previous</span>
