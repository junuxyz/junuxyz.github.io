Because of its importance and impact, there are already many high-quality explanations of <a href=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/>what the model is</a>, <a href=https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-transformer-llms-work/>how it works</a>, and even <a href=https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/>annotated code implementation of it</a>. These days, most developers don’t need to implement Transformers from scratch because libraries like <a href=https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>HuggingFace Transformers</a> provide easy-to-use classes and methods. Yes, there are plenty of things to build on top of the architecture! Still, I think it is worth having a great understanding of Transformer Model, beyond intuitive, abstract level. In fact one of the best way to learn Transformer, as <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7306651-what-i-cannot-build-i-do-not-understand>Feynman said</a>, is to build one yourself from scratch to really understand and appreciate all the underlying techniques and modules that form the base of the ChatGPT era.</p><p><strong>How is this different from other content?</strong><br>Before I start, I do strongly recommend reading other resources as well. However note that each sources has different layers of abstraction (or depth of explanation). The <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>paper itself</a> is fairly straightforward but not chronologically ordered, so it can be hard to follow in details.<br><em><a href=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/>The Illustrated Transformer</a></em> is beginner-friendly, abstracting away many implementation details and excels at explaining the overall big picture. On the other hand, <em><a href=https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/>The Annotated Transformer</a></em> is very deep, building the entire architecture end to end in PyTorch. But since it follows the paper’s order (which isn&rsquo;t chronological) and leaves out some explanations, readers who only have an abstract understanding of the model may feel overwhelmed or questionable.</p><p>Also note that Transformer is not a single monolithic block—it’s made up of many modularized layers (tokenization, positional encoding, encoder-decoder model, self-attention, cross-attention, etc.). Unless you already have a solid background in deep learning and NLP, it’s hard to fully understand all the pieces in one go. You’ll often need additional resources, and repeated exposure, to get comfortable with it.</p><p>While there are many great explanations of the mathematics and abstract concepts, I think the end-to-end shape changes and detailed explanation of code implementation are often missing. This blog post specifically aims to enhance the reader’s intuition about what the input actually looks like in real code, how it gets transformed step by step, and how it eventually can successfully predict the “next token”.</p><p>Hopefully this helps you form a more concrete understanding of the architecture and makes the code easier to read and implement :)</p><h1 id=commonly-used-parameters>Commonly Used Parameters</h1><p>Before we talk about shape transformation, it is helpful to understand the names of the parameter/notations. It will help the code readability. If you are familiar with the paper and the parameters used, feel free to skip this section.</p><h3 id=n--b-or-nbatches>$N$ , $b$, or <code>nbatches</code></h3><p>The Paper use the expression $N$ but in code, it is expressed as <code>nbatches</code>.<br>The reason why you may be confused about <code>nbatches</code> in code implementation from Annotated Transformer is because most explanation (including the original paper) omit about it.</p><p>The most representative image of Transformer is usually</p><ol><li>One head from one batch or</li><li>Multi-Head from one batch<br>but they don&rsquo;t explicitly tell there are <code>nbatches</code> batches processed parallel for each batch.</li></ol><p>The reality is, $N$ sentences are put into batch and passed as input. But this doesn’t change or introduce anything new to the original architecture we know. Still it&rsquo;s worth noting that <code>nbatches</code> mean the number of sentences being processed per batch. It will appear in the code several times.</p><p>Ex. let’s say $N=3$. That means we have $3$ sentences per batch.</p><h3 id=s-or-n_seq>$S$ or <code>n_seq</code></h3><p><code>n_seq</code> means the number of tokens in one sentence. Since Transformer utilizes parallel processing, we need to pre-define (statically) the length of the sentence. Usually we define it based on the longest sentence.</p><p>For example,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>I love you            --3
I am in love with you --6
I love you, too       --5
</code></pre><p>in this case, since the longest sentence in the batch is $6$, we can set <code>n_seq = 6</code>.<br>For the sentences that have less tokens than 6 will be filled with mask. We will see how mask(padding) is implemented later in this post.</p><h3 id=d_textmodel-or-d_model>$d_{\text{model}}$ or <code>d_model</code></h3><p><code>d_model</code> is the dimensionality of the <strong>residual stream</strong>, i.e., the vector size that represents each token throughout the Transformer.</p><p>All major components, including Embedding, Attention, and Feed-Forward layers, produce outputs of shape <code>(N, S, d_model)</code>. This uniform dimension ensures that residual connections (<code>x = x + sublayer(x)</code>) can be applied seamlessly across all sublayers.<br>In the original paper, <code>d_model</code> was set to 512.</p><h3 id=vocab-or-vocab>$vocab$ or <code>vocab</code></h3><p><code>vocab</code> is number of all token (or token ID). It depends on how you tokenize it.</p><p>(I think prior resources didn’t explain about the exact input of Transformer architecture clearly but I think it’s worth noting.)</p><p>First, even before the transformer process begins, there something called a Tokenizer which is independent from the Transformer Architecture. The tokenizer splits raw sentences into seqeunce of tokens.</p><p>For example if the raw sentence input was <code>I love you</code>, Tokenizer would divide it into tokens,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[&#34;I&#34;, &#34;love&#34;, &#34;you&#34;]
</code></pre><p>and using the $vocab$ dictionary, we map the tokens with its correspoining token id (one-on-one match)</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[0, 1, 2]
</code></pre><p>Now <strong>this (sequences of token id)</strong> is the input of the Transformer Architecture.</p><p>Then you might ask <strong>what the input of Transformer is</strong>.<br>The very first step of Transformer is Embedding and this is done by selecting the row from <code>W_emb</code> using the token ID as a key: <code>W_emb[token ID]</code></p><pre tabindex=0><code>token_id = 1 (&#34;love&#34;)
→ W_emb[1] = [0.13, -0.25, 0.91, ..., 0.07] 
</code></pre><p>Since the vector representation of token has size of $d_\text{model}$ (as mentioned above) The shape of $W_\text{emb}$ will be $(vocab, d_{\text{model}})$.</p><p>tldr:</p><ul><li><code>vocab</code> means number of all possible tokens, which depends on the Tokenizer.</li><li>After the token is converted into token id, the sequence of token ids become the actual “input” of the Transformer Architecture (The most left, below from the Transformer Architecture image)</li></ul><h3 id=parameters-specifically-used-during-attention-calculation>Parameters specifically used During Attention Calculation</h3><p>Below are the parameters only seen in Attention Calculation (Self-Attention and Cross-Attention)</p><h3 id=h-h-or-h>$H$, $h$, or <code>h</code></h3><p><code>h</code> is a hyperparameter which means the number of head of Multi-Head Attention.<br>In the original paper, researchers set it as <code>h = 8</code>.</p><h3 id=d_k-or-d_k>$d_k$ or <code>d_k</code></h3><p><code>d_k</code> is the vector size of key($K$) representation of each token.</p><p>We will look into more detail about how shape transforms during Multi-Head Attention in the upcoming section, but to shortly address, $Q$(query) and $K$(key) are matrix multiplied($QK^T$) to get the Attention Score. Therefore <code>d_q</code> must be the same as <code>d_k</code>.</p><p>In the original paper, <code>d_k</code> is set to <code>d_model // h</code>($512/8 = 64$). While <code>d_k</code> does not strictly have to equal <code>d_model // h</code>, this configuration ensures that the concatenated output of all attention heads matches the original <code>d_model</code> dimension. This structural alignment allows the output to be added directly to the residual connection without additional linear projections or dimension adjustments, thereby maximizing computational efficiency.</p><h3 id=d_v-or-d_v>$d_v$ or <code>d_v</code></h3><p><code>d_v</code> is the dimension of the value($V$) vector for each token.</p><p>After the attention weights are calculated, they are multiplied by the Value matrix $V$. This process yields a new set of vectors, each with dimension <code>d_v</code>, that now holds the contextual information from the sequence. This output is then used to help predict the next token.<br>(Don&rsquo;t worry if this sounds too compact. I will explain it in more detail later.)<br>In the original &ldquo;Attention Is All You Need&rdquo; paper, the authors set <code>d_v = d_k = d_q</code>. However, while <code>d_k</code> must equal <code>d_q</code>, it&rsquo;s not required for d_v to be the same size. This is simply another design choice. I will also explain later in this post when <code>d_v != d_k</code> is acceptable.</p><h1 id=how-shape-changes-end-to-end-w-code-example>How Shape Changes, End to End (w/ Code Example)</h1><p>When we encounter the code implementation of Transformer Architecture, all kinds of <code>view()</code>, <code>transpose()</code>, <code>reshape()</code> methods are frequently used, hindering what are being changed , what it implies, and why we need to do it. After all, if you understand there is a general order within the parameters and the shape form all has its meanings, code readability can significantly enhance.</p><p>Before we start, a simple but effective tip is to remember that most calculations<br>(token embedding, self-attention, feed-forward, etc.) in Transformer are applied <strong>per token</strong>(<code>d_model</code>).</p><p>In practice, the input shape is <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code>, which means each sequence has <code>n_seq</code> tokens and each batch has <code>nbatches</code> sentences. Almost all operations are performed independently on each of these tokens (in parallel). So you can think of it as running the same function <code>nbatches × n_seq</code> times in parallel.</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s explore the journey from the very first embedding to the last output (next token) and see how the shape changes and what they all mean. (In most paper or images, they often omit <code>nbatches</code> or <code>h</code> for clarity but I will explain including all the parameters). Then we will see how code is actually written to match these shapes. We won&rsquo;t cover all code, just the shape transformation parts, for simplicity. Also, to give you a clear intuition of how everything is working, I will use the three following sentences I used above. Code can be found in &mldr; :</p><h2 id=0-input-both-encoder--decoder>0. Input (both Encoder & Decoder)</h2><p>As mentioned above, this is a step before the transformer architecture even starts. It&rsquo;s a process to convert raw sentences into sequence of tokens. For example, based on <a href=https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer>GPT-4o & GPT-4o mini tokenizer</a> provided by OpenAI,</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-Plain data-lang=Plain><span class=line><span class=cl>I love you

Positional Embedding</h3><p>We won&rsquo;t go into detail about positional embedding in this post, since itself is a post-worth concept. I recommend <a href=https://kazemnejad.com/blog/transformer_architecture_positional_encoding/>this post</a> for better understanding of Positional Embedding. Since our main focus here is to see how the shapes change, I will explain mainly on that point of view.</p><p>To briefly explain, Positional Embedding is adding same(<code>d_model</code>)-sized vector to each embedded token to preserve the positional information. Unlike other sequence neural networks such as LSTM or RNN, Transformer calculates all tokens parallel. Therefore, if it doesn&rsquo;t have positional information added, it wouldn&rsquo;t know the order of the token. While using $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions are not the only way to preserve positional information, it is known to be a helpful way to do that.</p><p>We add the positional information of <code>d_model</code> to each embedded tokens and since they have the same shape, the shape does not change.</p><p><strong>shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq_src, d_model) → (nbatches, n_seq_src, d_model)</code></strong></p><p>Back to our example, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; has three positions.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-mathematica data-lang=mathematica><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=n>PE</span><span class=p>[</span><span class=mi>0</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=err>:</span><span class=p>]</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>=</span><span class=w> </span><span class=p>[</span><span class=w> </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=err>...</span><span class=w> </span><span class=p>]</span><span class=w>   </span><span class=nv>#</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>pos</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=mi>0</span><span class=w>

(which means this process is parallelly done in the sentences &ldquo;I am in love with you&rdquo; and &ldquo;I love you, too&rdquo; as well!)</p><p>Since attention itself doesn&rsquo;t have the ability to consider positions, we add additional information to each tokens. Since the positional embedding vector is also <code>d_model</code> size vector, we simply add them and there is no shape change.</p><h2 id=2-encoder-layer>2. Encoder Layer</h2><p>Now we move to the Encoder Layer. Code implementation of Encoder (and Decoder) Layer in code seems like a matryoshka doll (module inside a module inside a module&mldr;) but I will try to explain the big picture as clearly as possible.</p><p>In the blueprint, <strong>Encoder</strong> is consisted of $N$ Layers of <strong>Encoder Layer</strong>. (Note that Encoder and Encoder Layer are NOT the same! Also note that $N$ here and <code>nbatches</code> are totally different, independent concepts!) In the original paper $N=6$ which means we go over the Encoder layer 6 times in a single process.</p><p>Each Encoder Layer has two <strong>Sublayers</strong>: <strong>Self-Attention Sublayer</strong> first and then <strong>Feed Forward Network($FFN$) Sublayer</strong>. After each sublayers are passed, they are connected to a residual stream and then layer-wise normalized(LayerNorm).</p><p>In code, <strong>Sublayers</strong> are the most fundamental building blocks in Encoder-Decoder structure of Transformer Architecture. The two types of sublayers are already mentioned above.</p><p>Now that we went over the modules inside Encoder in a brief top-down approach, we will first go over the shape/dimension changes in Self-Attention Sublayer, then Feed Forward Network Sublayer and will expand further.</p><h3 id=2-1-multi-head-self-attention-mha>2-1. Multi-Head Self Attention (MHA)</h3><img src=/images/shaped-attention-attention.png alt=Image><p>When the input enters an Encoder Layer, its first destination is the Self-Attention sublayer.<br>To understand what happens here, we need to talk about <strong>Multi-Head Attention</strong>.<br>Though this post isn&rsquo;t a deep theoretical dive, the core idea is simple: Instead of calculating attention just once, we use multiple &ldquo;attention heads.&rdquo; Think of it like having several experts look at the same sentence; each expert (or head) can focus on different relationships between words. Each head has its own set of learned weights (<code>W_Q</code>, <code>W_K</code>, <code>W_V</code>) to find these different relationships. In the original paper, they use 8 heads (<code>h=8</code>).</p><p>Mathematically we represent Attention calculation as</p><p>$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V$$</p><p>This module is one of the most complicated part in Transformer so we will look in detail, step by step. The goal is to get a clear sense of how shape changes during each process. We are going to divide the Self-Attention process into 8 minor steps.</p><p>We start from input from 1-2<br><strong>shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq_src, d_model)</code> (shapes unchanged)</strong></p><div class="note-block note-info"><div class=note-icon>ℹ️</div><div class=note-content><div class=note-title>Note</div><div class=note-body>From now, we will call the input as <code>x</code></div></div></div><p><strong>2-1-1. Forward Pass to Q,K,V</strong><br>In Self Attention, inputs are copied and passed to three different Forward Passes which each has independent weights($W_Q, W_K, W_V$). The size of the weights are all <code>(d_model, d_model)</code>. This happens &ldquo;per token&rdquo; and the vector size of the token stays the same so shape does not change.</p><p><strong>shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq_src, d_model)</code> (shapes unchanged)</strong></p><p>For example, the sentence &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; (with 3 <code>&lt;PAD></code> tokens) will be:<br><img src=/images/shaped-transformer-example-5.png alt=Image></p><p><strong>2-1-2. Split heads</strong><br>As mentioned above each <code>h</code> is <code>d_model // d_k</code> so we need to split <code>d_model</code> into <code>h × d_k</code>):<br><strong>shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq_src, d_model) → (nbatches, n_seq_src, h, d_k)</code></strong><br><img src=/images/shaped-transformer-example-6.png alt=Image></p><p><strong>2-1-3. Transpose sequence length with head</strong><br>We transpose the sequence length with head in order to parallelize head processing.<br><strong>shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq_src, h, d_k) → (nbatches, h, n_seq_src, d_k)</code></strong><br><img src=/images/shaped-transformer-example-7.png alt=Image></p><p><strong>2-1-4. Compute attention scores</strong><br>Attention score is calculated by $\text{softmax}(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})$. Since $\sqrt{d_k}$ is just for scaling, if we look at $QK^T$, we are matrix multiplying $Q$ (<code>(nbatches, h, n_seq_src, d_k)</code>) with $K^T$(<code>(nbatches, h, d_k, n_seq_src)</code>). Therefore attention score for a single sequence, for each head, for each batch is size of <code>n_seq x n_seq</code>.<br><code>(nbatches, h, n_seq_src, d_k) → (nbatches, h, n_seq_src, n_seq_src)</code></p><p>for each head:<br><img src=/images/shaped-transformer-example-8.png alt=Image></p><p><strong>2-1-5. Softmax</strong><br>Apply softmax function to the attention score (doesn&rsquo;t affect the shape)<br><code>(nbatches, h, n_seq_src, n_seq_src)</code> (shapes unchanged)</p><p><strong>2-1-6. Multiply by V</strong><br>If attention score (calculated by $Q,K$) tells which token each token should &ldquo;attend to&rdquo;, $V$ tells which aspect/information to use from the token. We matrix multiply Attention Score with shape <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq_src, n_seq_src)</code> with V of shape <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq_src, d_k)</code> thus resulting as:<br><code>(nbatches, h, n_seq_src, n_seq_src) → (nbatches, h, n_seq_src, d_k)</code></p><img src=/images/shaped-transformer-example-9.png alt=Image><p><strong>2-1-7. Transpose back & concat</strong><br>Now we need to transpose the order of h and n_seq_src again. This is because calculation for Multi Head Self Attention is finished and we want to concatenate each head&rsquo;s output.<br><code>(nbatches, h, n_seq_src, d_k) → (nbatches, n_seq_src, h, d_k)</code> (transpose)<br><code>(nbatches, n_seq_src, h, d_k) → (nbatches, n_seq_src, d_model)</code> (concat)<br><img src=/images/shaped-transformer-example-10.png alt=Image><br><strong>2-1-8.

What is <code>W_O</code> and why do we need it?<br>A. After concatenation, each head&rsquo;s output simply sits side-by-side without interaction. <code>W_O</code> allows Cross-head integration &ndash; allows the model to learn combinations across different heads. e.g., combining a syntactic pattern captured by head 2 with a semantic pattern from head 5.</div></div></div><p><code>W_O</code> is shape of <code>(d_model, d_model)</code> so there is no shape change during this process.<br><strong>shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq_src, d_model)</code> (shapes unchanged)</strong></p><p>If we look the code implementation of <em>Annotated Transformer</em>,</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=k>class</span> <span class=nc>MultiHeadedAttention</span><span class=p>(</span><span class=n>nn</span><span class=o>.</span><span class=n>Module</span><span class=p>):</span>
