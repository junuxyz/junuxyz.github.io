Understanding Transformer</h2><p><strong>How can one learn Transformer?</strong><br>The Transformer Architecture (introduced in the paper <em><a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>Attention is All You Need</a></em>) is one of the most successful models in deep learning and the backbone of what made the “ChatGPT moment” possible. Because of its importance and impact, there are already many high-quality explanations of <a href=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/>what the model is</a>, <a href=https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-transformer-llms-work/>how it works</a>, and even <a href=https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/>annotated code implementation of it</a>. These days, most developers don’t need to implement Transformers from scratch because libraries like <a href=https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index>HuggingFace Transformers</a> provide easy-to-use classes and methods. Yes, there are plenty of things to build on top of the architecture! Still, I think it is worth having a great understanding of Transformer Model, beyond intuitive, abstract level. In fact one of the best way to learn Transformer, as <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7306651-what-i-cannot-build-i-do-not-understand>Feynman said</a>, is to build one yourself from scratch to really understand and appreciate all the underlying techniques and modules that form the base of the ChatGPT era.</p><p><strong>How is this different from other content?</strong><br>Before I start, I do strongly recommend reading other resources as well. However note that each sources has different layers of abstraction (or depth of explanation). The <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>paper itself</a> is fairly straightforward but not chronologically ordered, so it can be hard to follow in details. <em><a href=https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/>The Illustrated Transformer</a></em> is beginner-friendly, abstracting away many implementation details and excels at explaining the overall big picture. On the other hand, <em><a href=https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/>The Annotated Transformer</a></em> is very deep, building the entire architecture end to end in PyTorch. But since it follows the paper’s order (which isn&rsquo;t chronological) and leaves out some explanations, readers who only have an abstract understanding of the model may feel overwhelmed or questionable.</p><p>Also note that Transformer is not a single monolithic block—it’s made up of many modularized layers (tokenization, positional encoding, encoder-decoder model, self-attention, cross-attention, etc.). Unless you already have a solid background in deep learning and NLP, it’s hard to fully understand all the pieces in one go. You’ll often need additional resources, and repeated exposure, to get comfortable with it.</p><p>While there are many great explanations of the mathematics and abstract concepts, I think the end-to-end shape changes and detailed explanation of code implementation are often missing. This blog post specifically aims to enhance the reader’s intuition about what the input actually looks like in real code, how it gets transformed step by step, and how it eventually can successfully predict the “next token”.</p><p>Hopefully this helps you form a more concrete understanding of the architecture and makes the code easier to read and implement :)</p><h2 id=1-commonly-used-parameters>1. Commonly Used Parameters</h2><p>Before we talk about shape transformation, it is helpful to understand the names of the parameter/notations. It will help the code readability. If you are famaliar with the paper and the parameters used, feel free to skip this section.</p><h3 id=n--b-or-nbatches>$N$ , $b$, or <code>nbatches</code></h3><p>The Paper use the expression $N$ but in code, it is expressed as <code>nbatches</code>.</p><p>The reason why you may be confused about <code>nbatches</code> in code implementation from Annotated Transformer is because most explanation (including the original paper) omit about it.</p><p>The most representative image of Transformer is usually</p><ol><li>One head from one batch or</li><li>Multi-Head from one batch</li></ol><p>but they don&rsquo;t explicitly tell there are <code>nbatches</code> batches processed parallely for each batch.</p><p>The reality is, $N$ sentences are put into batch and passed as input. But this doesn’t change or introduce anything new to the original architecture we know. Still it&rsquo;s worth noting that <code>nbatches</code> mean the number of sentences being processed per batch. It will appear in the code several times.</p><p>Ex. let’s say $N=3$. That means we have $3$ sentences per batch.</p><h3 id=s-or-n_seq>$S$ or <code>n_seq</code></h3><p><code>n_seq</code> means the number of tokens in one sentence. Since Transformer utilizes parallel processing, we need to pre-define (statically) the length of the sentence. Usually we define it based on the longest sentence.</p><p>For example,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>I love you            --3
I am in love with you --6
I love you, too       --5
</code></pre><p>in this case, since the longest sentence in the batch is $6$, we can set <code>n_seq = 6</code>.<br>For the sentences that have less tokens than 6 will be filled with mask. We will see how mask(padding) is implemented later in this post.</p><h3 id=d_textmodel-or-d_model>$d_{\text{model}}$ or <code>d_model</code></h3><p><code>d_model</code> is the dimensionality of the <strong>residual stream</strong>, i.e., the vector size that represents each token throughout the Transformer.</p><p>All major components, including Embedding, Attention, and Feed-Forward layers, produce outputs of shape <code>(N, S, d_model)</code>. This uniform dimension ensures that residual connections (<code>x = x + sublayer(x)</code>) can be applied seamlessly across all sublayers.</p><p>In the original paper, <code>d_model</code> was set to 512.</p><h3 id=vocab-or-vocab>$vocab$ or <code>vocab</code></h3><p><code>vocab</code> is number of all token (or token ID). It depends on how you tokenize it.</p><p>I think prior resources didn’t explain about the exact input of Transformer architecture clearly but I think it’s worth noting.</p><p>First, even before the transformer process begins, there is a thing called Tokenizer which is independent from the Transformer Architecture. The tokenizer splits raw sentences into seqeunce of tokens.</p><p>For example if the raw sentence input was <code>I love you</code>, Tokenizer would divide it into tokens,</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[&#34;I&#34;, &#34;love&#34;, &#34;you&#34;]
</code></pre><p>and using the $vocab$ dictionary, we map the tokens with its correspoining token id (one-on-one match)</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[0, 1, 2]
</code></pre><p>Now <strong>this (sequences of token id)</strong> is the input of the Transformer Architecture.</p><p>Then you might ask <strong>what&rsquo;s the input of Transformer then?</strong></p><p>The very first step of Transformer is Embedding and this is done by selecting the row from <code>W_emb</code> using the token ID as a key: <code>W_emb[token ID]</code></p><pre tabindex=0><code>token_id = 1 (&#34;love&#34;)
→ W_emb[1] = [0.13, -0.25, 0.91, ..., 0.07] 
</code></pre><p>Since the vector representation of token has size of $d_\text{model}$ (as mentioned above) The shape of $W_\text{emb}$ will be $(vocab, d_{\text{model}})$.</p><p>tldr:</p><ul><li><code>vocab</code> means number of all possible tokens, which depends on the Tokenizer.</li><li>After the token is converted into token id, the sequence of token ids become the actual “input” of the Transformer Architecture (The most left, below from the Transformer Architecture image)</li></ul><h3 id=parameters-specifically-used-during-attention-calculation>Parameters specifically used During Attention Calculation</h3><p>Below are the parameters only seen in Attention Calculation (Self-Attention and Cross-Attention)</p><h3 id=h-h-or-h>$H$, $h$, or <code>h</code></h3><p><code>h</code> is a hyperparameter which means the number of head of Multi-Head Attention.<br>In the original paper, researchers set it as <code>h = 8</code>.</p><h3 id=d_k-or-d_k>$d_k$ or <code>d_k</code></h3><p><code>d_k</code> is the vector size of key($K$) representation of each token.</p><p>We will look into more detail about how shape transforms during Multi-Head Attention in the upcoming section, but to shortly address, $Q$(query) and $K$(key) are matrix multiplied to get the Attention Score. Therefore <code>d_q</code> must be the same as <code>d_k</code>.</p><p>In the paper <code>d_k = d_model // h</code> which is $64$ ($=512/8$). Most people think <code>d_k</code> must be <code>d_model // h</code> but this is just a design choice and totally depends on the developer. I will explain cases where this is not always true, while it&rsquo;s still efficient to use <code>d_k = d_model // h</code>.</p><h3 id=d_v-or-d_v>$d_v$ or <code>d_v</code></h3><p><code>d_v</code> is the dimension of the value($V$) vector for each token.</p><p>After the attention weights are calculated, they are multiplied by the Value matrix $V$. This process yields a new set of vectors, each with dimension <code>d_v</code>, that now holds the contextual information from the sequence. This output is then used to help predict the next token.<br>(Don&rsquo;t worry if this sounds too compact. I will explain it in more detail in the next section!)</p><p>In the original &ldquo;Attention Is All You Need&rdquo; paper, the authors set <code>d_v = d_k = d_q</code>. However, while <code>d_k</code> must equal <code>d_q</code>, it&rsquo;s not required for d_v to be the same size. This is simply another design choice. I will also explain later in this post when <code>d_v != d_k</code> is acceptable.</p><br><h2 id=2-the-big-picture-tldr>2.

How Shape Changes, end to end (w/ Code Examples)</h2><div class="note-block note-info"><div class=note-icon>ℹ️</div><div class=note-content><div class=note-title>Note</div><div class=note-body>This section is working in progress!</div></div></div><p>When we encounter the code implementation of Transformer Architecture, all kinds of <code>view()</code>, <code>transpose()</code>, <code>reshape()</code> methods are frequently used, hindering what are being changed , what it implies, and why we need to do it. After all, if you understand there is a general order within the parameters and the shape form all has its meanings, code readability can significantly enhance.</p><p>Before we start, a simple but effective tip is to remember that most calculations<br>(token embedding, self-attention, feed-forward, etc.) in Transformer are applied <strong>per token</strong>(<code>d_model</code>).</p><p>In practice, the input shape is <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code>, which means each sequence has <code>n_seq</code> tokens and each batch has <code>nbatches</code> sentences. Almost all operations are performed independently on each of these tokens (in parallel). So you can think of it as running the same function <code>nbatches × n_seq</code> times in parallel.</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s explore the journey from the very first embedding to the last output (next token) and see how the shape changes and what they all mean. (In most paper or images, they often omit <code>nbatches</code> or <code>h</code> for clarity but I will explain including all the parameters). Then we will see how code is actually written to match these shapes. We won&rsquo;t cover all code, just the shape transformation parts, for simplicity. Also, to give you a clear intuition of how everything is working, I will use the three following sentences I used above. Code can be found in &mldr; :</p><h3 id=tokenizing>Tokenizing</h3><p><strong>shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq)</code></strong></p><p>As mentioned above, this is a step before the transformer architecture even starts. It&rsquo;s a process to convert raw sentences into sequence of tokens.

I recommend <a href=https://kazemnejad.com/blog/transformer_architecture_positional_encoding/>this post</a> for better understanding of Positional Embedding. Since our main focus here is to see how the shapes change, I will explain mainly on that point of view.</p><p><strong>input shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code></strong></p><p>To briefly explain, Positional Embedding is adding same(<code>d_model</code>)-sized vector to each embedded token to preserve the positional information. Unlike other sequence neural networks such as LSTM or RNN, Transformer calculates all tokens parallely. Therefore, if it doesn&rsquo;t have positional information added, it wouldn&rsquo;t know the order of the token. While using $\sin$ and $\cos$ functions are not the only way to preserve positional information, it is known to be a helpful way to do that.<br>We add the positional information of <code>d_model</code> to each embedded tokens and since they have the same shape, the shape does not change.</p><p><strong>output shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code></strong></p><p>Back to our example, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; has three positions.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code class=language-mathematica data-lang=mathematica><span class=line><span class=cl><span class=n>PE</span><span class=p>[</span><span class=mi>0</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=err>:</span><span class=p>]</span><span class=w> </span><span class=o>=</span><span class=w> </span><span class=p>[</span><span class=w> </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>0.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w>  </span><span class=mf>1.00</span><span class=p>,</span><span class=w> </span><span class=err>...</span><span class=w> </span><span class=p>]</span><span class=w>   </span><span class=nv>#</span><span class=w> </span><span class=n>pos</span><span class=o>=</span><span class=mi>0</span><span class=w>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s break down the last line.</p><p>For conveninece we make four Linear Layer of shape <code>(d_model, d_model)</code> for <code>W_q, W_k, W_v, W_o</code> and save it in ModuleList.</p><div class="note-block note-info"><div class=note-icon>ℹ️</div><div class=note-content><div class=note-title>Note</div><div class=note-body>To be accurate it&rsquo;s <code>(d_model, h, d_k)</code> but for sake of convenience, since <code>d_model = h * d_k</code>, we write as <code>(d_model, d_model)</code> for sake of convenience.</div></div></div><p>We <code>zip</code> it with tuple <code>(query, key, value)</code>. Since we don&rsquo;t need q,k,v for <code>W_o</code>, it is intended to zip with only three tuples.<br>Since <code>query, key, value</code> are all shape of <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code>, we pass it through <code>lin(x)</code>. since the Linear Layer itself has the same input and output size, the output of query, key, value after the Linear Layer have the same shape <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code>. However we transpose it to <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq, d_k)</code> to make matrix multiplication available for parallel processing of each heads.</p><p><strong>3. Transpose for Attention Calculation</strong><br>To perform the attention calculation ($QK^T$) across all heads at once, we need <code>n_seq</code> and <code>d_k</code> to be the last two dimensions. So we transpose the shape $Q$ into <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq, d_k)</code>. Since $K^T$ is transposed version of $K$, its shape is <code>(nbatches, h, d_k, n_seq)</code>.</p><p><strong>4. Calculate Attention Scores</strong><br>We calculate $QK^T$ and the output shape becomes <code>(nbatches, h , n_seq, n_seq)</code> due to matrix mulitplicatin.<br>After calculating, as you see in the mathematical definition, we scale it by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$ to make it <code>n_seq</code>-agnostic.<br>Mathematically this process is</p><p><strong>6. Mask Padding Tokens</strong><br>Padding tokens are just placeholders to match all the sentence to length of <code>n_seq</code> for the sake of matrix calculation. Therefore we need to exclude them on applying to $V$. Therefore we mask the padding tokens in the key. We don&rsquo;t need to mask the query matrix since it matrix multiplies with masked key tokens and automatically gets eliminated.</p><p><strong>7. Apply Softmax</strong><br>We apply a softmax function to the scores, which turns them into positive values that sum to 1. This converts the scores into attention <strong>weights</strong>. The shape remains <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq, n_seq)</code>.</p><p><strong>8. Apply Attention to V</strong> Now we multiply our attention weights by the Value matrix <code>V</code>. This enhances the representation of each token by incorporating information from the other tokens it&rsquo;s paying attention to.<br>Attention weight shape: <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq, n_seq)</code><br><code>V</code> shape: <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq, d_v)</code> (where <code>d_v = d_k</code> in the original paper)<br>Output = <code>weights @ V</code> and its shape becomes <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq, d_v)</code></p><p><strong>9. Concatenate Heads</strong><br>The parallel processing for each head is done. Now we want to merge our <code>h</code> heads back into a single tensor. We reverse the transpose from step 3.<br>so the shape changes from <code>(nbatches, h, n_seq, d_v)</code> to <code>(nbatches, n_seq, h, d_v)</code>.</p><p><strong>10. Reshape to Final Output</strong><br>Finally, we flatten the <code>h</code> and <code>d_v</code> dimensions back into the original <code>d_model</code> dimension. This is the <code>reshape()</code> or <code>view()</code> call(in code) that concludes the process.<br>Shape changes from <code>(nbatches, n_seq, h, d_v)</code> to <code>(nbatches, n_seq, h * d_v)</code>.<br>Since <code>h * d_v = d_model</code>, our final output shape is <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code>, which is exactly what we started with! This allows us to pass it to the next layer in the network.</p><p>This output is then passed through a final linear layer, <code>W_O</code>, which also doesn&rsquo;t change the shape.</p><p>final output shape: <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code></p><div class="note-block note-info"><div class=note-icon>ℹ️</div><div class=note-content><div class=note-title>Note</div><div class=note-body><ul><li>In practice, each attention head receives the <strong>same full input</strong> of shape <code>(nbatches, n_seq, d_model)</code>. The difference between heads comes entirely from their learned projection weights $(W_Q, W_K, W_V)$. Heads do not split the input; instead, they naturally learn to focus on different subspaces of the same representation.</li></ul><p>Below are two common parts most people are wrong about, or didn&rsquo;t think of.</p><ul><li>Does <code>d_k</code> have to be <code>d_model // h</code>?<br>No, but it&rsquo;s a very practical choice to make.<br>The main reason is to ensure the output of the attention block matches the shape as the input. This is crucial for the residual connection(<code>x = x + MHA(x)</code>).<br>When <code>d_k = d_model // h</code>, After we concatenate the heads, the final dimension is <code>h * d_k = h * (d_model / h) = d_model</code>. The output shape <code>(..., d_model)</code> perfectly matches the input shape, so the residual connection works seamlessly. When <code>d_k</code> is different from <code>d_model // h</code>, The concatenated dimension becomes <code>h * d_k</code>, which is not equal to <code>d_model</code>. This creates a shape mismatch. To fix this, the final linear layer (<code>W_O</code>) must act as a projection, mapping the shape from <code>h * d_k</code> back to <code>d_model</code>. So it&rsquo;s just a practical and rational design choice to keep the dimension consistent.</li><li>Does <code>d_k</code> have to match <code>d_v</code>?<br><strong>No</strong>, not at all.<br>While the query and key dimensions (<code>d_q</code> and <code>d_k</code>) must be identical for the dot product to work, the value dimension (<code>d_v</code>) can be any size you want.<br>The output dimension after applying attention and concatenating the heads is always <code>h * d_v</code>. The final linear layer, <code>W_O</code>, is responsible for projecting this <code>h * d_v</code> dimension back to <code>d_model</code> to ensure the residual connection works.<br>In fact, the <code>W_O</code> layer makes the choice of <code>d_v</code> very flexible. Its job is to take whatever the heads output (<code>h * d_v</code>) and reshape it into the <code>d_model</code> dimension that the rest of the network expects. Setting <code>d_k = d_v</code> is just a common simplification.</li></ul><p>To summarize both questions above, if we just make sure <code>d_k = d_q</code> (for attention calculation) and shape of <code>W_O</code> as <code>(h * d_v, d_model)</code>, <code>d_k</code> and <code>d_v</code> can be whatever integer it can be. However by matching <code>d_k</code> and <code>d_v</code> based on <code>d_model</code> makes residual connection seamless and computationally efficient.</p></div></div></div><p>Back to our example, &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; sentence</p><h3 id=2-2-residual-connection-and-normalization>2-2.
